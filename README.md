# BigNum-Library-in-x86-Assembly
Sometimes 32 bit is not enough. Well for those times we can use a bignum library, but why use one when you can make your own?

<p>Big nums are numbers that go beyond the limitations of the system you are working on <br>
For example allowing higher than 32-bit mathematics on a 32-bit processor<br>
There are 4 main math operations that are needed to be handled<br>
  1) Addition<br>
  2) Substruction<br>
  3) Multiplication<br>
  4) Division (Some choose to ignore this, but I want to make one for fun)</p> <br>
