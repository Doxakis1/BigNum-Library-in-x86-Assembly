# BigNum-Library-in-x86-Assembly
Sometimes 32 bit is not enough. Well for those times we can use a bignum library, but why use one when you can make your own?

<p>Big nums are numbers that go beyond the limitations of the system one works on
For example allowing higher than 32-bit mathematics on a 32-bit processor
There are 4 main math operations that are needed to be handled
  1) Addition
  2) Substruction
  3) Multiplication
  4) Division (Some choose to ignore this, but I want to make one for fun)</p>
